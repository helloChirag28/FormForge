## üîß Configuration

### Ollama Configuration

The AI integration can be customized in `app/api/generate-form/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Modify these settings for different behavior
{
  model: 'llama3.2:3b',        // Change model
  temperature: 0.3,            // Creativity (0-1)
  top_p: 0.8,                 // Diversity (0-1)
  max_tokens: 1500,           // Response length
}
```

### Adding New Models

To use a different Ollama model:

1. Download the model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull model-name
   ```

2. Update the model name in the API route:
   ```typescript
   model: 'model-name'
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Ollama Issues

**"Ollama API error"**: 
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Restart Ollama service
brew services restart ollama
```

**"No response from Ollama"**:
```bash
# Test Ollama directly
ollama run llama3.2:3b "Hello"
```

### API Route Issues

**"Internal server error"**:
- Ensure Ollama is running on port 11434
- Check the server logs for detailed errors
- Verify the model is downloaded: `ollama list`

### Development Server

**Port conflicts**:
- The app runs on port 3000 by default
- Ollama uses port 11434
- Make sure both ports are available
